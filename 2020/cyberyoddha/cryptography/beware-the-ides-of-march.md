# Beware the Ides of March

## Task

JFJAM{j@3$@y_j!wo3y}

## Solution

A quick analysis of the given string and we see that char 1 and 3 are the same so this is a substition cipher. Since special chars are unchanged it's probably rotation aka cesar chiffre. If we try it for every possible rotation number we find `19` is correct: `CYCTF{c@3$@r_c!ph3r}`
