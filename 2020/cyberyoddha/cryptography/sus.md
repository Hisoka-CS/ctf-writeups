## Task

We picked up on some suspicious activity at a nearby salad bar. We sat down to talk with the manager. He was quite nervous during the interview, but he slid this message to us: ooflgqofllcedopwvtnhyacwllhehdl. Can you find out what it means?

Hint: We ordered some salad as well, and we made sure to have it drizzled with some vinegar.

## Solution

It's probably vigener `vinegar` cipher with password salad.

`SALAD	wouldyoulikesomevinegarwiththat`

Now we just wrap `CYCTF{}` around it.
