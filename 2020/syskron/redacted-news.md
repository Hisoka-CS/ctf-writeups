# Redacted networks

## Task

Oh, this is a news report on our Secure Line project. But someone removed a part of the story?!

## Solution

There is a redacted part in the news article. Converting the png to jpg make that part visible again:

```bash
convert 2020-10-1-secureline.png 2020-10-1-secureline.jpg
```
