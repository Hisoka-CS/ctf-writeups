# So Easy

## Task

File: easy.pcapng

## Solution

We open `wireshark` again.

Looking for `http` we find some `POST` requests. Looking at the `HTML Form URL Encoded`:

```
HTML Form URL Encoded: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Form item: "username" = "JISCTF{V3RY_34SY_PC4P_F1L3}"
    Form item: "password" = "password"
    Form item: "Login" = "Login"
```
