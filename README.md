# CTF Writeups

## About this repository

### Structure

You can find writeups for various CTF challenges here. To keep them organized I sorted them by year and event.

Inside each event you can find all writeups that I produced.

Sometimes there are sorted into folders corresponding to the category. This happens only when the writeup is interesting, there were many tasks in that category or just a lot of writeups for that event.

I might change that in the future, I didn't want to create folders for each month because some start and end in differnt months. After publishing the first ones and referencing them on different platforms changing the URL was a no-go, so I sticked with that, at least for the current year to make things consistent.

### Ambition

This can be used as a resource on how to approach certain challenges. Most writeups are limited to a specific task so you will have to search for them yourself.

I will try to create a list of used tools below.

### Indexing

Interesting challenges that you should know and understand can be found in the next section. Those are the ones I liked the most and where I tried to make everything as clear as possible writing my solution down after approaching the task.

### Eventualities

If you have any questions, suggestions or improvements feel free to collaborate using issues or pull requests.
